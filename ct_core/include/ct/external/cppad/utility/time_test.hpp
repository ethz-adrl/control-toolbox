$section Determine Amount of Time to Execute a Test$$
$mindex time_test speed$$

$head Syntax$$
$codei%# include <cppad/utility/time_test.hpp>
%$$
$icode%time% = time_test(%test%, %time_min%)%$$
$icode%time% = time_test(%test%, %time_min%, %test_size%)%$$

$head Purpose$$
The $code time_test$$ function executes a timing test
and reports the amount of wall clock time for execution.

$head Motivation$$
It is important to separate small calculation units
and test them individually.
This way individual changes can be tested in the context of the
routine that they are in.
On many machines, accurate timing of a very short execution
sequences is not possible.
In addition,
there may be set up and tear down time for a test that
we do not really want included in the timing.
For this reason $code time_test$$
automatically determines how many times to
repeat the section of the test that we wish to time.

$head Include$$
The file $code cppad/time_test.hpp$$ defines the
$code time_test$$ function.
This file is included by $code cppad/cppad.hpp$$
and it can also be included separately with out the rest of
the $code CppAD$$ routines.

$head test$$
The $code time_test$$ argument $icode test$$ is a function,
or function object.
In the case where $icode test_size$$ is not present,
$icode test$$ supports the syntax
$codei%
	%test%(%repeat%)
%$$
In the case where $icode test_size$$ is present,
$icode test$$ supports the syntax
$codei%
	%test%(%size%, %repeat%)
%$$
In either case, the return value for $icode test$$ is $code void$$.

$subhead size$$
If the argument $icode size$$ is present,
it has prototype
$codei%
	size_t %size%
%$$
and is equal to the $icode test_size$$ argument to $code time_test$$.

$subhead repeat$$
The $icode test$$ argument $icode repeat$$ has prototype
$codei%
	size_t %repeat%
%$$
It will be equal to the $icode size$$ argument to $code time_test$$.

$head time_min$$
The argument $icode time_min$$ has prototype
$codei%
	double %time_min%
%$$
It specifies the minimum amount of time in seconds
that the $icode test$$ routine should take.
The $icode repeat$$ argument to $icode test$$ is increased
until this amount of execution time (or more) is reached.

$head test_size$$
This argument has prototype
$codei%
	size_t %test_size%
%$$
It specifies the $icode size$$ argument to $icode test$$.

$head time$$
The return value $icode time$$ has prototype
$codei%
	double %time%
%$$
and is the number of wall clock seconds that it took
to execute $icode test$$ divided by the value used for $icode repeat$$.

$head Timing$$
The routine $cref elapsed_seconds$$ will be used to determine the
amount of time it took to execute the test.

$children%
	cppad/utility/elapsed_seconds.hpp%
	speed/example/time_test.cpp
%$$
$head Example$$
The routine $cref time_test.cpp$$ is an example and test
of $code time_test$$.
